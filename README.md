## CSCI 2000U Scientific Data Analysis Final Project (Group 12) - Heart Failure

### Description:
    This project was submitted as the final course project for CSCI 2000U “Scientific Data Analysis” during Fall 2021 that explores the dataset of heart failure patients
    using methods learnt throughout the CSCI 2000U course. The file "Final_Project.ipynb" reads the .csv file and creates data tables and graphs to explore the     
    information.
    The file "Final_Project_Blog.ipynb" is a notebook file that uses Markdown to convey the information from "Final_Project.ipynb" to a broader group of people using a
    scientific blog format. 

    The entire project was developed and tested on Deepnote (which also uses Jupyter Notebooks).

### Installation:
    1. On the main page of the project in Github, click on 'Code' and download as .zip.
    2. Extract the file into a new folder for easier access.
    3. Either go to a website that offers support for (coding) notebooks such as [Deepnote](https://deepnote.com) and upload the files or set up your own instance of Jupyter Notebooks.

### How To Use:
    For "Final_Project.ipynb":
        1. Run the entire notebook to ensure that everything runs properly. 
                (Note: if you ever find that something may be broken or seem unusual, try running the entire notebook to be be safe.)
        2. Run the code block where `display(df.describe(include='all'))` is located. 
                For some odd reason that we don't understand, the first run of the code does not include the `include='all'` option.

    For "Final_Project_Blog.ipynb"
        1. It should be ready without needing to run it but if needed, run the entire notebook.
